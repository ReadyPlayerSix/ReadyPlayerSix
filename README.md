## About Me

With over 10 years of experience in IT and cyber operations. My experience lately has been primarily network administration, customer support, IT systems troubleshooting and repair, and cyber warfare and defensive methodologies. Though I do have extensive knowledge and proficiency in data analysis, interpretation, and presentation using Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint, and UI/UX application design using VBA in the past. Recently I've been engaged in a self-directed research project where I use my programming skillset and leverage AI to augment my new technical skills through my AutoML and Machine Learning Optimization projects.
